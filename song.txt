Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
And I say, Hello Satan, I
I believe it is time to go
Me and the devil walking side by side
Me and the devil walking side by side
And I am gonna see my man
Until I get satisfied
See, see you don't see why
And you would dog me around
Say, don't see why
People dog me around
It must be that old evil spirit
So deep down in your ground
You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
You may bury my body
Down by the highway side
So my old evil spirit
Can Greyhound bus that ride
So my old evil spirit
Can Greyhound bus that ride
