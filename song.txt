Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
Early this morning
When you knocked upon my door
And I say, Hello Satan, I
I believe it is time to go
Me and the devil walking side by side
Me and the devil walking side by side
And I am gonna see my man
Until I get satisfied
See, see you don't see why
And you would dog me around
